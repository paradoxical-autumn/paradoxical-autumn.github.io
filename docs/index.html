        <p class="one_liner">a programmer and musician who draws and does 3d stuff sometimes</p>
        <p class="large-text">Hi! I'm Autumn. I'm a programmer from the UK who also spends time making artsy stuff! I don't just program as I'm good at it, I program as I want to do it. I share this passion along with everything else in life, whether it be hobbies, jobs or whatever else.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, I also enjoy digital art, composing music and 3D texturing. You can view these on my <a href="/alt_portfolio.html">alternate portfolio.</a></p>

                    <p>I made this website entirely within two days, to host my portfolio and other stuff! This was my
                        first major attempt at HTML and CSS. Pleanty of people say I did a good job at it!</p>

                    <p><i>Before I Sleep</i> was a short indie horror game made by myself and a few teammates for
                        college. I was the only programmer on the team and we managed to get our first prototype
                        released within 2 weeks. The actual game is yet to follow.</p>

                    <p><i>Resonite</i> is a hybrid between a game engine and a game. It's also a social space and has its own community. I make projects in it - including items, avatars and worlds - along with plugins for FrooxEngine, the underlying software powering it.</p>

                    <p>This was a prototype I created to test my skills within learning a new engine, being <a

                    <p>This prototype tested my skills to:</p>

                    <p>This was my second attempt at a Roblox horror game. It was going to be driven by a story and a
                        fixed camera point of view. Work on this has been placed on indefinite hold whilst I finish
                        college, so it never entered early access.</p>

                    <p class="subtext">Roblox (Lua)</p>
                    <p>This was a Roblox game I was working on, before I had to shut work down due to personal reasons.
                        It was going to be an infinite room generating horror game which sees the player traversing an
                        office building to try and get further and further than before. <a
