                    <p><i>Before I Sleep</i> was a short indie horror game made by myself and a few teammates for
                        college. I was the only programmer on the team and we managed to get our first prototype
                        released within 2 weeks. The actual game is yet to follow.</p>

                    <p>This prototype tested my skills to:</p>

                    <h1>Untitled Horror Game</h1>
                    <p>This was my second attempt at a Roblox horror game. It was going to be driven by a story and a
                        fixed camera point of view. Work on this has been placed on indefinite hold whilst I finish
                        college, so it never entered early access.</p>

                    <p>This was a Roblox game I was working on, before I had to shut work down due to personal reasons.
                        It was going to be an infinite room generating horror game which sees the player traversing an
                        office building to try and get further and further than before. <a
